Integrate With External Service
The website hosted displays the simple calculator which takes two integers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. 
<br/>The external webservice that I used is the US dollar to Euro currency convertor. The output from the webservice gives the standard rate of dollar in terms of Euro. The user inputs a value of USD and it is processed using the output of the webservice to generate the corresponding Euro currency value.
<br/>
To access the service http://54.244.41.255:5000/
